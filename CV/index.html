                                    <p>I came to MySmartChat (child project of GraphGrail) as contractor to help to
        choose suitable technologies, develop architecture of front-end and to make
        MVP. But the idea of project fascinated me and I stayed in it until the end.</p>
                                    <p>After the core of prototype and UI-kit were developed, I counseled our HRs in
        front-end developers recruitment, interviewed. Then I mentored junior
        developers, realised code-review, controlled code-style and code quality.</p>
                                    <p>I have taken part in a product launch as product manager. The main part of my job was behavior
        analysis of early adopters. I conducted user interviews, collected and analysed
        feedback. Wrote user stories, defined requirements for engineering team,
        generated and tested ideas, based on collected data.</p>
                                    <p>Also, important thing was customer on-boarding, delivering product demos for
        new features — I captured short videos of functionality usage, described features
        and trained our support team and first users.</p>
                                    <p>Besides this, I helped to search for investors and took part in negotiations.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, we had no designer in team, so I made design prototypes too.</p>
